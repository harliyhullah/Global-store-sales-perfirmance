#  Project Overview
## Title: Global Sales Performance Analysis (2014‚Äì2017)
This project explores a global store‚Äôs sales data from 2014 to 2017. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that analyzes total sales, profit, orders, product performance, regional distribution, and sales team efficiency.  
It identifies top-selling products, high-performing regions, underperforming categories, and uncovers trends to inform business strategy.
